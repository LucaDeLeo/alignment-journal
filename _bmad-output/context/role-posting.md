The Alignment journal is a new peer-reviewed academic venue for foundational AI alignment research, launching in spring 2026. We're experimenting with mechanisms that don't exist in current journals: LLM-assisted desk rejection, paid peer review with speed/quality incentives, and “reviewer abstracts” that publish alongside papers. The journal is nonprofit, currently funded by the AI Safety Tactical Opportunities Fund. Principles of Intelligence (PIBBSS’s parent org) is our fiscal sponsor. [Read more about our plans here](https://woozy-page-39c.notion.site/Alignment-Journal-Description-Jan-2026-2e9398af2ab0816ea6cdf847f6447b46).

We need software to handle submission, editorial workflow, review, and publication. The technical approach is not yet fixed — we want to make that decision with you. Options range from low-code (Airtable + Softr + Make), to adapting existing open-source platforms (Kotahi, Janeway, Forum Magnum), to building bespoke. Software will by default be released open source and developed in the open.

This is a founding-engineer role: you will be joining a small team, working directly with editors [Jess Riedel](https://jessriedel.com/) and [Dan MacKinlay](https://danmackinlay.name/). We will all be answering emails and doing some grunt work. You’ll get feedback directly from our users: editors, reviewers, and authors. You will have high autonomy and you'll be in the room for all decisions, including non-engineering ones. We want someone who will argue for their preferred approach, not wait for instructions, and do whatever it takes to drive review quality up and submission-to-publication time down.

You will design and implement an end-to-end editorial workflow for academic manuscripts, including:

Author submission flow (account creation, submission form, PDF upload)

Editor dashboard: status, blockers, reminders, audit trail of communications

Action-editor assignment and reviewer recruitment workflow (email-first, with web UI for reviews/discussion)

Semi-confidential review mechanics (reviewer anonymity during review; configurable post-decision disclosure)

Review UI: long-form reviews + discussion threads, with a usable UX for “smart but busy” reviewers

Publication pipeline for accepted papers (web-first article pages + PDFs; basic indexing metadata, integration with the 3rd-party crossref DOI system)

Payment tracking for reviewers (who was paid how much and why; payments themselves can be manual initially)

Automated “LLM triage” to flag clear, checkable issues before reviewer time is spent (likely run on every submission once implemented)

We care about UX; OpenReview is our anti-model. We intend to quickly experiment, throw out what doesn’t work, etc.

You want to help reduce risks from powerful AI systems

You've built complete web applications (frontend + backend + deployment)

You're comfortable with ambiguity and can scope your own work

You have opinions about how to balance shipping fast vs. building properly

You like getting rapid feedback from a small pool of smart, opinionated users

You're interested in academic publishing, LLM tooling, and/or incentive design

Previous experience with editorial systems (as an author, editor, or reviewer) is a plus but not required. We don't know exactly how senior you need to be; if you're unsure whether to apply, apply.
